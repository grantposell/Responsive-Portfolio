        <!--About Me Paragraphs-->
        <p id="desc">Howdy Everyone! My name is Grant Posell and I am currently seeking an entry level web development position. Growing
            up, I knew I was interested in technology and the rapid advent of the web. I just didn't know how I could influence
            people's lives and make a difference. Post my graduation at Texas A&amp;M, I realized that I had to change my
            perspective on what I could or couldn't do. I needed to break down barriers and decide that I needed to make
            a change of course. I would need to buckle down and complete a coding course where I could become well equipped
            to set out on my own and be put in the right direction to learn. I know through learning and practice, I will
            find the right company where I can make an impact.
            <br/>
            <br/> My hope and desire is to find a company where I can be a part of a dynamic team where I can grow and impact
            both members in the team and the company. Every member of a team must possess grit, coachability, focus and a
            desire to succeed. I believe with my background and experience that I can exceed expectations with these skills.
            Through my passions and accumen, I know I can be a valuable asset to any team. Take a look through my portfolio
            and send me a message if you want to connect further. I look forward to hearing from you.
        </p>
